    "### B. Information storage method\n",
    "\n",
    "I will first define a class called 'Task' and store the information of each activity as an instance. Each activity will contain eight data fields including id, description, duration, start_time, end_time, parent_task, dependency, and status. It will be possible to identify whether a task is a parent activity or a subtask by checking the value of the field 'parent_task'.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Description of scheduler\n",
    "\n",
    "By utilizing the method 'get_tasks_ready' in the class 'SimpleScheduler', I assigned 3 different priority values for each task. Since each activity has 3 subtasks, one subtask is designed to have maximum 2 dependencies. If a subtask has 2 dependencies, the priority value is 30. If a subtask has 1 dependency, the priority value is 20. If a subtask has no dependency, the priority value is 10. For the tasks that have specific time constraints, I didn't assign any priority value but created a logic that they can be started at the exact time they are supposed to begin. Therefore, the tasks with time constraints are stored in 'time_queue', which is different from 'ordinary_queue'.\n",
    "\n",
    "A priority queue is well-suited for scheduling my tasks because it prioritizes the elements according to specified criteria. An ordinary queue is not appropriate because it usually orders elements in a first-in-first-out manner. As described above, I assign different priority values for each task and use 'heappush' method to append it into a min-heap. The 'heappop' method pulls the first task out of the min-heap and the scheduler will be able to run the appropriate task."

    "\n",
    "First of all, I need to add an extra feature that distinguishes whether a task could be multitasked or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first major modification would be made in 'get_tasks_ready' method. When I push each task into the heap, I assign a certain priority value based on its number of dependencies. After the process, I will add an if statement checking whether the task is multitaskable or not. If it is, I will subtract 1 from the priority value so that they can have bigger priority and be located next to each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second major modification is on 'run_scheduler' method. If the task popped from the queue is multitaskable, it will check the next task in the queue. If the next task is also multitaskable, the function will operate both tasks simultaneously and update the current time with the longer one among the durations of both tasks. The process of removing dependency, updating status, and checking parent activity will be the same. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Constraints handling\n",
    "\n",
    "The constraints will be handled by assigning different priority values to the tasks that are in similar categories. For example, booking a hotel and reserving a restaurant can't be executed simultaneously because they both require a phone call. It is not possible to make multiple calls simultaneously. Similarly, purchasing a train ticket and making a hair shop reservation can't be executed simultaneously because they both require launching an app. It is not possible to launch multiple apps simultaneously on the same phone. Therefore, I will create a new field called 'category' and assign a different priority value to the task if it has a specific category. This will make two tasks with a similar category apart from each other in the queue, preventing them from being executed at the same time. "
